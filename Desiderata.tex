\subsection{Three desiderata of distributed systems applications}

Given the particular details of civil aviation and disaster response,
this section lists three desirable features of distributed
applications.

\begin{description}
\item[D1] Quantifiable bounds on inconsistency
\item[D2] Ability to accomodate a heterogeneous collection of system nodes
\item[D3] Optimization for geographic ad-hoc communications networks
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Quantifiable bounds on inconsistency}

\emph{An application should provide a way to quantify the amount of
consistency it delivers by placing upper bounds on observable
inconsistency.}

\subsubsection{Accommodation of heterogeneous nodes}

\emph{Applications should not assume that there is a ``typical''
system node. The system should accomdate a potentially diverse range
of heterogeneous clients with different capabilities and goals.}

\subsubsection{Optimization for a geographic ad-hoc communications network}

\emph{Applications should be optimized for the particular
characteristics of real-world communications patterns over
geographically-based, ad-hoc wireless networks.}
