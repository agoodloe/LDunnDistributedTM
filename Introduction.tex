\section{Introduction}
Civil aviation has primarily been focused on efficiently moving goods
and people via the airspace to their destination. The application of
sound engineering practices and conservative operating procedures has
made flying the safest mode of transport. Now the desire not to
compromise this safety makes it challenging to introduce uncrewed
vehicles into the airspace. The rules for operating in the US national
airspace are typically relaxed during natural disasters and relief
efforts, however. The NASA Aeronautics' Airspace Operations and Safety
Program (AOSP) System Wide Safety (SWS) project has been investigating
how crewed and uncrewed aircraft may safely operate in shared
airspace, taking wildfire fighting and hurricase relief as use cases.

Disaster response scenarios like the ones under consideration present
a number of unique challenges for safe operations, particularly from a
communications point of view. Traditionally, civil aviation has
employed simple communication patterns between air and ground and
among aircraft. For instance, a typical airborne communication
protocol is Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), by
which aircraft monitor and periodically broadcast information about
their position and velocity to air traffic controllers and nearby
aircraft. The use cases under consideration demand more sophisticated
coordination between airborne and ground-based elements in order to
accomplish shared mission goals such as operating safely, delivering
resources, and fighting fires. However, the operating environment will
not admit the use of reliable, high-bandwidth internet connections
that consistently allow clients to transmit large amounts of data
quickly.

A highly centralized network topology would be brittle in our use
cases. Instead, we presume something like an ad-hoc wide area mesh
network using geographic routing \cite{}, say one supported by the
deployment of portable communication towers. Due to its ad-hoc nature,
and the particulars of our use cases, a robust communications
framework cannot rely on many hypotheses the performance of the
network. For example, issues like distance, terrain, smoke, and
weather mean we should expect network packets to be dropped or delayed
in unpredictable ways.

The need for sophisticated coordination is in tension with the fact
that the communications environment is unpredictable and difficult to
control, as an unreliable network makes it difficult to coordinate
among agents and offer strong safety guarantees. This is a challenge
of distributed computing, a subdiscipline of computer science. This
purpose of this memorandum is to enumerate some of the considerations
involved in coordinating air- and ground-based elements from a
distributed computing perspective, identifying challenges, potential
requirements, and frameworks that may aid in developing solutions.

The rest is laid out as follows. Section 2 provides a high-level,
informal introduction to the challenges of distributed computing. We
especially focus on Brewer's CAP theorem, highlighting the well-known
consistency/availability (C/A) tradeoff in the presense of network
partitions. We offer a list of three desiderata we might expect of
distributed applications in the contexts under consideration.  Section
3 explains how the framework of \emph{conits} \cite{} may be used for
quantifying the nature of the C/A tradeoff in the context of data
replication, a desirable feature for safety-critical systems. Section
4 is an introduction to applied sheaf theory, which provides a highly
general framework for measuring the mutual consistency of
``overlapping'' observations (i.e. ones which we expect to be
correlated if not equal, such as the data generated by a sensor
network). We discuss an simulated example, due to \cite{}, where
sheaves are used to integrate heterogeneous sensor data, thereby
improving an estimated location for a crashed aircraft. Section 5 is a
conclusion with suggestions for future work.
