  abstract     = {Communication support is a serious limitation for
                  Latin American firefighters when they deal with
                  emergency situations. The insufficient number of
                  radio channels and the impossibility to deliver
                  digital information force firemen to improvise
                  during response processes, e.g., to make decisions
                  using their experience and poor or null supporting
                  information. These improvised actions affect the
                  time required to take control of an emergency, and
                  also affect the evolution of the crisis
                  situation. Provided most of Latin American fire
                  companies are volunteer organizations, communication
                  solutions that could help to overcome these problems
                  are usually expensive for them. This article
                  presents a low-cost mobile collaborative
                  application, which may be used in emergency
                  situations to overcome most of the firefighters'
                  communication problems. The application, named
                  MobileMap, is the result of the research and
                  development work conducted by the authors, supported
                  by a Chilean fire company, during the last three
                  years. MobileMap allows ad hoc communication,
                  decisions support and collaboration among
                  firefighters in the field using mobile devices. This
                  solution complements the radio communication
                  systems. Since the interactions supported by
                  MobileMap are recorded, it is possible to analyze
                  such information after the crisis and learn for
                  future emergencies. The tool was evaluated in
                  simulated and real scenarios, and the obtained
                  results are highly encouraging.},

                  situation. This paper describes a system based on
                  mobile electronic triage tags that makes victim
                  information available at the base of operations as
                  soon as possible, thus allowing an early medical
                  resource allocation and immediate action. The
                  cornerstone of the system is mobile agent
                  technology, which allows information to be
                  transported asynchronously and reliably from
                  terminal to terminal and not requiring any network
                  infrastructure at all. This novel approach is ready
                  to be used in the worst case scenario, where only
                  small handheld devices carried by the emergency
                  personnel are available, but also integrates well
                  when synchronous connections are possible, for
                  instance when a mesh network can be created. The
                  system has been successfully implemented, showing
                  the feasibility of the proposal. By using this
                  low-budget system, the number of casualties during
                  the triage stage of an emergency is expected to drop
                  off.}

  abstract     = {A concurrent object is a data object shared by
                  concurrent processes. Linearizability is a
                  correctness condition for concurrent objects that
                  exploits the semantics of abstract data types. It
                  permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits
                  programmers to specify and reason about concurrent
                  objects using known techniques from the sequential
                  domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that
                  each operation applied by concurrent processes takes
                  effect instantaneously at some point between its
                  invocation and its response, implying that the
                  meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be
                  given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper
                  defines linearizability, compares it to other
                  correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a
                  method for proving the correctness of
                  implementations, and shows how to reason about
                  concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.},

                  availability are well understood. Traditionally,
                  however, designers of replicated systems have been
                  forced to choose from either strong consistency
                  guarantees or none at all. This paper explores the
                  semantic space between traditional strong and
                  optimistic consistency models for replicated
                  services. We argue that an important class of
                  applications can tolerate relaxed consistency, but
                  benefit from bounding the maximum rate of
                  inconsistent access in an application-specific
                  manner. Thus, we develop a conit-based continuous
                  consistency model to capture the consistency
                  spectrum using three application-independent
                  metrics, numerical error, order error, and
                  staleness. We then present the design and
                  implementation of TACT, a middleware layer that
                  enforces arbitrary consistency bounds among replicas
                  using these metrics. We argue that the TACT
                  consistency model can simultaneously achieve the
                  often conflicting goals of generality and
                  practicality by describing how a broad range of
                  applications can express their consistency semantics
                  using TACT and by demonstrating that
                  application-independent algorithms can efficiently
                  enforce target consistency levels. Finally, we show
                  that three replicated applications running across

                  but also researchers and students of computer
                  science, logic, linguistics, cognitive science,
                  philosophy, and any of the other fields in which the
                  ideas are being applied. Containing clear
                  definitions of the essential concepts, illuminated
                  with numerous accessible examples, and providing
                  full proofs of all important propositions and
                  theorems, this book aims to make the basic ideas,
                  theorems, and methods of category theory
                  understandable to this broad readership. Although
                  assuming few mathematical pre-requisites, the
                  standard of mathematical rigour is not
                  compromised. The material covered includes the
                  standard core of categories; functors; natural
                  transformations; equivalence; limits and colimits;
                  functor categories; representables; Yoneda's lemma;
                  adjoints; monads. An extra topic of cartesian closed
                  categories and the lambda-calculus is also provided
                  - a must for computer scientists, logicians and
                  linguists!This Second Edition contains numerous
                  revisions to the original text, including expanding
                  the exposition, revising and elaborating the proofs,
                  providing additional diagrams, correcting
                  typographical errors and, finally, adding an
                  entirely new section on monoidal categories. Nearly
                  a hundred new exercises have also been added, many
                  with solutions, to make the book more useful as a

                  of computational systems, the ontological status of
                  virtual worlds, the limitations of artificial
                  intelligence, philosophical aspects of data

                  involving over 100,000 hosts of the Internet system
                  and located in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific. The
                  experiments are designed to evaluate the
                  availability, accuracy and reliability of
                  international standard time distribution using the
                  DARPA/NSF Internet and the Network Time Protocol
                  (NTP), which is specified in RFC-1119. NTP is
                  designed specifically for use in a large, diverse
                  internet system operating at speeds from mundane to
                  lightwave. In NTP a distributed subnet of time
                  servers operating in a self-organizing,
                  hierarchical, master-slave configuration exchange
                  precision timestamps in order to synchronize subnet
                  clocks to each other and national time standards via
                  wire or radio. The experiments are designed to
                  locate Internet hosts and gateways that provide time
                  by one of three time distribution protocols and
                  evaluate the accuracy of their indications. For
                  those hosts that support NTP, the experiments
                  determine the distribution of errors and other
                  statistics over paths spanning major portions of the
                  globe. Finally, the experiments evaluate the
                  accuracy and reliability of precision timekeeping
                  using NTP and typical Internet paths involving
                  DARPA, NSFNET and other agency networks. The
                  experiments demonstrate that timekeeping accuracy
                  throughout most portions of the Internet can be
                  ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of
                  milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption
                  of clocks, time servers or networks. This memo does

  year         = 1992,
  publisher    = {University of California at Santa Cruz},
  address      = {USA},
  abstract     = {Many distributed systems for wide-area networks can
                  be built conveniently, and operate efficiently and
                  correctly, using a weak consistency group
                  communication mechanism. This mechanism organizes a
                  set of principals into a single logical entity, and
                  provides methods to multicast messages to the
                  members. A weak consistency distributed system
                  allows the principals in the group to differ on the
                  value of shared state at any given instant, as long
                  as they will eventually converge to a single,
                  consistent value. A group containing many principals
                  and using weak consistency can provide the
                  reliability, performance, and scalability necessary
                  for wide-area systems. I have developed a framework
                  for constructing group communication systems, for
                  classifying existing distributed system tools, and
                  for constructing and reasoning about a particular
                  group communication model. It has four components:
                  message delivery, message ordering, group
                  membership, and the application. Each component may
                  have a different implementation, so that the group
                  mechanism can be tailored to application
                  requirements.The framework supports a new message
                  delivery protocol, called timestamped anti-entropy,
                  which provides reliable, eventual message delivery;
                  is efficient; and tolerates most transient processor
                  and network failures. It can be combined with
                  message ordering implementations that provide
                  ordering guarantees ranging from unordered to total,
                  causal delivery. A new group membership protocol
                  completes the set, providing temporarily
                  inconsistent membership views resilient to up to k
                  simultaneous principal failures.The Refdbms
                  distributed bibliographic database system, which has
                  been constructed using this framework, is used as an
                  example. Refdbms databases can be replicated on many

  abstract     = {A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact
                  sequence of characters that identifies an abstract
                  or physical resource. This specification defines the
                  generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI
                  references that might be in relative form, along
                  with guidelines and security considerations for the
                  use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines
                  a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
                  allowing an implementation to parse the common
                  components of a URI reference without knowing the
                  scheme-specific requirements of every possible
                  identifier. This specification does not define a
                  generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed
                  by the individual specifications of each URI
                  scheme. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

  ABSTRACT     = {This paper proposes a Software-Defined Delay
                  Tolerant Networking (SDDTN) architecture as a
                  solution to managing large Delay Tolerant Networking
                  (DTN) networks in a scalable manner. This work is
                  motivated by the planned deployments of large DTN
                  networks on the Moon and beyond in deep
                  space. Current space communication involves
                  relatively few nodes and is heavily deterministic
                  and scheduled, which will not be true in the
                  future. It is unclear how these large space DTN
                  networks, consisting of inherently intermittent
                  links, will be able to adapt to dynamically changing
                  network conditions. In addition to the proposed
                  SDDTN architecture, this paper explores data plane
                  programming and the Programming Protocol-Independent
                  Packet Processors (P4) language as a possible method
                  of implementing this SDDTN architecture, enumerates
                  the challenges of this approach, and presents
                  intermediate results.},

  abstract     = {P4 is a high-level language for programming
                  protocol-independent packet processors. P4 works in
                  conjunction with SDN control protocols like
                  OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly
                  specifies protocol headers on which it
                  operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in
                  a few years, increasing the complexity of the
                  specification while still not providing the
                  flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we
                  propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow
                  should evolve in the future. We have three goals:
                  (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers
                  should be able to change the way switches process
                  packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol
                  independence: Switches should not be tied to any
                  specific network protocols. (3) Target independence:
                  Programmers should be able to describe
                  packet-processing functionality independently of the
                  specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example,
                  we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to
                  add a new hierarchical label.},
